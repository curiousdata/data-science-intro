# data-science-intro
Data science introduction repo for 1-year CS students

This repository contains a small, self‑contained example showing the basic steps of a data science workflow:

- Loading a tabular dataset (`flats.csv`) with pandas  
- Exploring the data with `df.head()` and simple scatter plots  
- Building a linear regression model to predict flat prices from size and room count  
- Inspecting model weights, visualizing the fitted line, and making new predictions
